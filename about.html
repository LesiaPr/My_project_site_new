              big white animal. The observatory is completely built of stone.The
              observatory had 5 floors, 43 rooms and 57 windows. This building

              territory of the station. He moved without a sound, so the

              still do not know what it was.

            <h2>Spitsy</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>About:</strong> Spitsy is one of the peaks of the
              Chornohora mountain. Spitsy is one of the most interesting
              mountains in the Carpathians. Its eastern slopes are fringed with
              rock ledges 20-50 m high, which really resemble spiers (hence the
              name of the mountain).

              <strong>Height:</strong> 1863 m above sea level.

              <strong> Trail length: </strong>

              13km.

              <strong>Takes time:</strong>
              6 hours.
              <br />
              <strong>Interesting facts:</strong>
              Here you can see whole rows of unusual rock ledges - these huge
              stone embankments of natural origin resemble spears from afar.
              Travelers say that you can see about 15 rows of rocks there. The
              Spitsy rocks were formed as a result of ancient mountain
              glaciation, which, according to scientists, took place
              approximately 2.5 million years ago.
